# Research

This folder is a workspace for **non-authoritative** explorations that inform Tidebreak design and implementation.

## What belongs here

- Feasibility spikes and prototype notes
- Tradeoff analyses and external references (papers, talks, postmortems)
- Playtest observations, hypotheses, and instrumentation ideas
- Benchmarks and “what we learned” write-ups

## What doesn’t belong here

- Authoritative feature designs → `docs/design/`
- Implementation contracts/specs → `docs/technical/`
- Finalized decisions → `docs/decisions/`

## Suggested structure

```markdown

## Naming

Use either `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md` or `topic.md` and keep it consistent across the folder.
